                <p className='text-center mx-10 mb-10'>“Meridians” focuses on interpretations of energy and transformation through the eye of photographers trained in fashion photography. The photographers represent diverse backgrounds and subjects, speaking to the universality of spirituality and the nuances in representations of intangible forces which shape our world and lived experiences. <br />

The exhibition features American photographer Robert Farber, whose impressionistic, painterly artistic style has been a staple in fashion photography for decades, French photographer Patrick James Michel, whose images capture the presence of spirituality in tribal communities, and emerging Vietnamese photographer Chiron Duong, whose dreamlike images combine Vietnamese culture with elements of the subconscious. </p>
